# Exception Handling Guide

## Damaged or Defective Items

### Immediate Escalation Required
When a customer reports that an item arrived damaged, defective, or broken, the case **must be escalated** to a human specialist immediately.

**Why:**
- Requires quality control inspection
- May need to file shipping claim
- Product defect may affect other orders
- Customer may need immediate replacement

**Process:**
1. Gather details: What is damaged? When was it discovered?
2. Request photos if possible (but don't require them)
3. Escalate to Quality Control team with priority: HIGH
4. Expected resolution: Same-day response from specialist

**Common Damaged Item Scenarios:**
- "Package arrived ripped open"
- "Screen is shattered"
- "Item doesn't work/power on"
- "Wrong item sent"
- "Missing parts or accessories"

### Defective vs. Changed Mind
**Defective:** Item doesn't function as intended, has manufacturing flaw
- No time limit restrictions (beyond warranty)
- No restocking fee
- Shipping costs covered by company

**Changed Mind:** Customer simply doesn't want the item
- Standard return windows apply
- Standard fees apply
- Customer pays return shipping (unless VIP)

## Fraud Prevention and High Return Customers

### Fraud Flag Scenarios
Accounts flagged for fraud require manual review before any return is approved.

**Escalation:** Priority HIGH
**Review Team:** Fraud Prevention Department

**Common Fraud Indicators:**
- Multiple returns of high-value electronics
- Wardrobing (returning worn clothing)
- Frequent "defective item" claims
- Mismatched return items (returning different product)
- Returns exceeding purchases

### High Return Frequency (3+ in 30 Days)
When a customer has 3 or more returns in a rolling 30-day window, additional verification is needed.

**Process:**
1. Politely explain: "I see you've had several recent returns. Let me connect you with a specialist who can better assist."
2. Escalate to Account Review team
3. Priority: MEDIUM (unless fraud flag, then HIGH)
4. Specialist will review account history and determine eligibility

**Do NOT:**
- Accuse customer of abuse
- Refuse the return outright
- Make customer feel unwelcome

## Return Window Exceptions

### Compassionate Circumstances
The following situations may qualify for return window extensions:

**Medical Emergencies:**
- Customer was hospitalized
- Family medical crisis
- Requires documentation
- Escalate to Customer Experience Manager

**Military Deployment:**
- Active duty military deployed unexpectedly
- Requires military ID verification
- Automatic approval for extension
- Escalate to VIP Services team

**Natural Disasters:**
- Hurricanes, wildfires, floods in customer's area
- Check FEMA disaster declaration
- Automatic approval if affected
- Escalate to Customer Experience Manager

**How to Handle:**
1. Express empathy: "I'm sorry to hear about that situation."
2. Explain: "While our standard policy is [X], we can make exceptions for circumstances like this."
3. Escalate with priority: MEDIUM and full context

### Expired Return Windows - Alternative Solutions

When a return is outside the window and no exception applies:

**Offer Alternatives:**
1. **Store Credit:** Offer 50% store credit for items 91-180 days old
2. **Exchange:** Allow exchange for different size/color within 120 days
3. **Donation:** We'll donate the item and provide tax receipt
4. **Loyalty Points:** Award bonus points as goodwill gesture

**Example Script:**
"I understand this is frustrating. While we can't process a full refund since the order is 95 days old, I can offer you store credit for 50% of the purchase price, or we could exchange this for a different item. Would either of those work for you?"

## Special Edition and Collectible Items

### Standard Process
Special edition items are typically final sale and non-returnable.

### VIP Exception
Gold and Platinum members MAY return special edition items within 30 days if:
- Item is in perfect, resalable condition
- All authentication certificates included
- Original packaging intact
- Requires manager approval

**Escalation Process:**
1. Verify customer loyalty tier (Gold or Platinum)
2. Confirm item condition via photos
3. Escalate to VIP Services Manager
4. Priority: MEDIUM
5. Response time: 24-48 hours

## Wrong Item Shipped

This is **always** our error and should be resolved immediately.

**Process:**
1. Apologize sincerely
2. Create RMA immediately (no eligibility check needed)
3. Offer options:
   - Ship correct item now, return wrong item later
   - Full refund + return wrong item
   - Keep wrong item at discount + receive correct item
4. Expedite shipping on correct item (next day if available)
5. Prepaid return label with no time pressure

**No Fees Apply:**
- No restocking fee
- No return shipping cost
- Full refund or replacement

## Gift Returns

### No Receipt
Customer can return a gift without a receipt if:
- Item is in our system (we can verify purchase)
- Standard return window applies
- Refund issued as store credit (not original payment method)

### Outside Return Window
If gift was purchased during holiday extension period (Nov 15 - Dec 31), return window extends to January 31.

**Verification:**
"Can you provide the order number or the gifter's email? I can look up the order details."

## Multiple Items, Mixed Eligibility

When a customer wants to return multiple items from one order, and some are eligible while others aren't:

**Process:**
1. Check each item individually
2. Clearly explain which items CAN be returned and why
3. Clearly explain which items CANNOT be returned and why
4. Process RMA for eligible items only
5. Offer alternatives for ineligible items

**Example:**
"I can process the return for the Red T-Shirt and Blue Jeans since they're within the 30-day window. However, the jacket was purchased 95 days ago and is outside our return window. I can offer you store credit for 50% of the jacket's price if that helps."

## System Errors and Technical Issues

When you encounter system errors:
1. Apologize for the inconvenience
2. Document the error (note the order number and error message)
3. Escalate to Technical Support
4. Priority: MEDIUM (HIGH if customer is frustrated)
5. Inform customer: "I've submitted a ticket to our technical team. You'll receive an email update within 24 hours."

## De-escalation Strategies

When customers are upset:

**Do:**
- Listen actively and acknowledge feelings
- Apologize for the situation (not for the policy)
- Offer alternatives and solutions
- Escalate if you can't resolve

**Don't:**
- Argue or defend
- Take it personally
- Make promises you can't keep
- Blame other teams or systems

**Example Response:**
"I completely understand your frustration, and I'm sorry we can't process a full refund in this situation. Let me see what I can do to make this right. I can offer [alternative]. Would that work for you? If not, let me connect you with my manager who may have additional options."
